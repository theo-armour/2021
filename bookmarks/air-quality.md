>PM10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller
> PM2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.
How small is 2.5 micrometers? Think about a single hair from your head. The average human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter â€“ making it 30 times larger than the largest fine particle.
