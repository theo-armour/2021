# 2021-05-09 ~ What is a family with no children?

The first definition in the Oxford dictionary for the word "family" is:

>a group of one or more parents and their children living together as a unit.

What, however, is the meaning of the word "family" if the children are grown up and everybody lives apart?

Me being in the latter state - and perhaps due to boredom or disinterest - I ask myself:

"what does Theo really want?"

I have the feeling that my connection with my family is frail, of small meaning and slightly insipid.

Me being me, rather than pointing fingers and assigning blame, I would rather draft and craft the things to know, be and do that might be pleasing.

Aphorism

Drop the "my" from "family" and you get "fail".
