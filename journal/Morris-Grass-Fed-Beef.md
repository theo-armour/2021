## My first question

If you want be holistic about this, where is the starting point? where do you begin?

Where to begin: the land ~ the animals ~ the ideas?

***

The following is a discombobulated series of notes, references and whatever that started as a list of possible questions to ask Joe which them morphed into some of his responses and even more references.

The use of this document is merely as a repository of the thoughts with no particular outcome in mind other than as a record of a delightful encounter.

## A walk in a field

So much knowledge in Joe's brain about nature, flora and fauna and life in general. Also also his care about living well, happily and gratefully. Some snippets that I remember

* Old grass in clumps suffocates new grass. Grazing helps
* The knobbly weeds are called plantains
* Chicory has leaves and stalks
* Spiders are indicators that life is coming back.
* In order for Oak leaves to decompose, you need rain
* After land has been cultivated, it takes a long time for the wild diversity to come back
* Frost kills bugs, frost keeps ground softer
* It cost $2,000 a year to feed an old horse
* It takes at least three cowboys to be a horse. Reverse that

Do you spend more time on the cattle or the grass?

Answer: The Grass

* American Grassfed Association (AGA) ~ https://www.americangrassfed.org/
> From the farm to the marketplace and in government policy, we support, advocate, and promote American grassfed and pasture-based farms and ranches.
>We do so by:
>Maintaining a credible, transparent national standard for animals humanely raised on pasture
>Partnering and collaborating to support rural economies
* www.grassfedexchange.com
> The Grassfed Exchange is a coordinated effort of producers and buyers of grassfed genetics that come together to form the Grassfed Exchange Committee. It is our desire to provide a means of education and exchange of grassfed genetics between producers. With quite a few conferences behind us that have been well received, we continue to promote the grassfed industry and grassfed genetics through education and display.
