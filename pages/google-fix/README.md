Hi Krishana

Thank you for taking this case on.

>> It seems that the issues are only with the Lynk app on your device.

Actually, currently there are two codes that do not work: Lyft is one plus one of the Google codes. The third one (for Uber) mysteriously started working again. Would you like me to search for others?

>> I suggest you check the permissions for the Lynk App on your device

Which device? I am currently testing on four devices? ;-)

BTW, I checked the Google Pixel 5. It reports "no permissions denied" for the Lyft app.
