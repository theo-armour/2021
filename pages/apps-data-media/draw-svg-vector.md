### Infinite Designer Usage

Nice

Quality: 200 ~ makes dots smaller ~ increases number of things to be calculated ~ slows things down
Colors: 32 ~ 16 or less creates more dots
Smooth: 1 < anything greater may create gaps ~ but better splotches
Minimum points: 0 - 2 ~ anything greater: more dots
Expand: 4
Simplify: 0 - 0.4 ~ not much difference ~ slows things down
Style: stack ~ best ~ flatten & stencil: round dots to surface ~
