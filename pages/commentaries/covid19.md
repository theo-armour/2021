>When someone makes the point that they haven’t been vaccinated and are doing fine, I say that’s true of most drunk drivers as well: Most of the time, they don’t cause an accident. Then the other person will say that anyway, it’s a personal decision or a matter of freedom. And I respond that I understand the point, but refusing a vaccination can also harm other people, just as drunk driving can.
