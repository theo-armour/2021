>The Problem
>We all read books that suggest a change – about our habits, about starting a business, fixing our psyche, and ourselves in general – but we rarely do anything with the information we are so quick to ingest. In most situations, we read something and quickly move on to the next “big” idea, never fully understanding the real context of what we have consumed.

>The Solution
>Thinkers Club is designed to help you focus on thinking and doing. Instead of speed-read all available books and torture your easily distracted mind with 24/7 content consumption, you focus on one topic, one book each month. Once you join, every month, you’ll receive a Think Workbook (a practical guide outlining the key strategies from a single book followed by guided writing exercises) so you can engage with the content like never before.
