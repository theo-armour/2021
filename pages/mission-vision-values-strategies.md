* outlines what the organization wants to be
* how it wants the world in which it operates to be (an "idealized" view of the world).
* a long-term view and concentrates on the future
* can be emotive[citation needed] and is a source of inspiration.

* What we want to become, to be
* Where are we going?

## Values

Beliefs that are shared among the stakeholders of an organization.
Values drive an organization's culture and priorities and provide a framework in which decisions are made.

* How do we want to behave?
* What do we stand for?
* Our ethics, principles, beliefs

## Strategies

Strategy, narrowly defined, means "the art of the general" - a combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.

A strategy is sometimes called a roadmap - which is the path chosen to plow towards the end vision.

The most important part of implementing the strategy is ensuring the company is going in the right direction - defined as towards the end vision.

How we will achieve our vision?
How are we going to progress?
