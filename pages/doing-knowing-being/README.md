## Concept

My current major ontology/epis of life effort

* How look at something and make sense of it
* How do you know what you know?
* How can you find it again
* How can you compare whatever

## Critical Thinking

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking

Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:[16]

* An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
* Knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning
* Some skill in applying those methods.
