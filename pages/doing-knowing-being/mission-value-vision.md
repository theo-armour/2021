## Strategies

Strategy, narrowly defined, means "the art of the general" - a combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there. 

A strategy is sometimes called a roadmap - which is the path chosen to plow towards the end vision. 

The most important part of implementing the strategy is ensuring the company is going in the right direction - defined as towards the end vision.

* How we will achieve our vision?
* How are we going to progress?

## Inspirations

Responding to questions is easier when you have good templates to build upon.

Below are texts that I look to for inspiration.

### Tina Fey ~ For Rules of Improv

1. You must agree
2. “Yes” isn’t enough, you must “yes, and…”
3. Make statements.
4. There are no mistakes!


### Saint Paul’s School ~ The School Prayer ~ https://www.sps.edu/living/chapel-program

Theo: I am an atheist. I strip out all the god stuff here and keep the rest

> "Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."


### Roosevelt

> “This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in.”


### Serenity Prayer ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer

>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
>courage to change the things I can,
>and wisdom to know the difference.


### Happiness

How can be happy when others are unhappy?

### Problems & Patterns

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Burning Man > The 10 Principles of Burning Man

> Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey wrote the 10 Principles in 2004 as guidelines for the newly-formed Regional Network. They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception.
