## Books

Links to two or three books that provide up to date good diet guidelines.

> Podiatrists and chiropodists are both medical professionals specialised in the treatment of the lower limb. The difference between the names is geographical. While chiropodist describes foot specialists in the UK and Ireland, podiatrist originates in the United States and is more internationally recognised.
