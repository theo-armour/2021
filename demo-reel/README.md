## Concept

View a few of the projects Theo Armour has scripted in the past few years.

* All code is plain-vanilla JavaScript with a single dependency - [Three.js]( https://threejs.org )
* Easy for beginners to hack
* Easy for full-stack developers to embed into complex situations
* All code is free, open source with MIT license and hosted on GiHub
* In most instances there are Read Me files with background and links of interest


## To Do / Wish List

* Continue modernizing the elderly broken scripts
* Make more scripts available
* Add more context and background to the scripts' read me files

## Issues

* Many older projects still call for http instead https and therefor will not load
* Many older projects are based on earlier versions but call for the dev version and there for crsh


## Links of Interest

* [Read Me Driven Development](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25222601 )
